# vit-classification
Fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) on the Beans image classification dataset using Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets libraries. This project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, apply real-time transformations, fine-tune a ViT model, evaluate performance, and visualize results with a confusion matrix.
